# Navigation rail

Navigation rails let people switch between UI views on mid-sized devices

- Use navigation rails in medium, expanded, large, or extra-large window sizes
- Can contain 3-7 destinations plus an optional FAB
- Always put the rail in the same place, even on different screens of an app

_Collapsed and expanded navigation rails can transition between each other on any device, including:_

1. Large or medium window size classes like tablets
2. Compact window size classes like phones in portrait orientation

_The collapsed and expanded navigation rails match visually and can transition into each other_

## Differences from M2

- Behavior: Predictive back interaction
- Color: New color mappings and compatibility with dynamic color
- States: The active destination can be indicated with a pill shape in a contrasting color

_M2: The navigation rail uses icon color, weight, and fill to communicate which destination is active_
